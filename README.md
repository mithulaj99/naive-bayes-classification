# naive-bayes-classification

## Overview
This repository contains a Machine Learning project implemented in Python using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for a classification problem.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure

naive-bayes-classification/
│
├── naive_bayes.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with implementation
├── dataset.csv # Dataset used (if applicable)
├── README.md # Project documentation


## Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature extraction / vectorization  
4. Train-test split  
5. Train Naive Bayes model  
6. Evaluate model performance  

## Algorithm Used
- **Naive Bayes**
  - Multinomial / Gaussian (based on dataset)
- Implemented using **scikit-learn**

## Results
The model achieves effective classification performance after proper preprocessing. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix are included in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/naive-bayes-classification.git
2. Open the notebook:
 jupyter notebook naive_bayes.ipynb

 ## Use Case
